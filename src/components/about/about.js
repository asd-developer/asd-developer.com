            <p>
                I have always been a visual person, I started by getting interested in UI/UX and that lead me to my first experience with coding.<br/>
                <br/>I wrote my first line of JavaScript and got addicted ever since, then I started doing project after project and I am now looking for my first job as a Front-end Developer.<br/>
                <br/>Iâ€™m a professional hobbyist (I like mostly to skateboard, spearfish, travel and pilot racing drones.).
            </p>
