              <br/>
              I consider myself a life long learner who is passionate about the latest front-end technologies. I love solving problems with code and creating responsive, professional-looking websites. I am also interested in cloud technologies and serverless applications. <br/>
            <br/>I have always been a visual person, I started by getting interested in UI/UX and that leads me to my first experience with code.<br/>
                <br/>I wrote my first line of JavaScript and got addicted ever since then I started doing project after project and I am now looking for opportunities to improve my skills as a Front-end Developer.<br/>
                <br/>Iâ€™m a professional hobbyist (I like mostly to skateboard, spearfish, travel, and pilot racing drones).
