            <p>
              <br/>
            I started having an interest in technology when I was young, I wanted to know how to use the tools that were available to me in the best way.<br/>
            Now, I want to help make the tools that will be used by many, and shape the future I was born in by creating responsive websites with both good looks and functionality.<br/>
            <br/>I have always been a visual person, I started by getting interested in UI/UX and that leads me to my first experience with code.<br/>
                <br/>I wrote my first line of JavaScript and got addicted ever since then I started doing project after project and I am now looking for opportunities to improve my skills as a Front-end Developer.<br/>
                <br/>Iâ€™m a professional hobbyist (I like mostly to skateboard, spearfish, travel, and pilot racing drones).
